# xcb-handmade
A adaptation of some of the [handmade hero's](https://handmadehero.org/) platform layer, properly organized by day

## Warnings

1. The project does not include any of the original source code; it only includes platform and script files.
2. The project is not a 1-to-1 translation of the series nor is it intended to work with the original source code.
3. The project is intended for people to study and understand how certain things done in
    [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/), which originally used Windows, can also be achieved in Linux on the same low level.
